# Streaming Service — Policy Specification

## Context

This policy governs access control for a streaming video platform.
Principal types: FreeMember and Subscriber. Resources: Movie and Show.
Subscribers have `subscription.tier` (String) and `profile.isKid` (Bool).
Movies have: `isFree`, `needsRentOrBuy`, `isOscarNominated` (Bool).
Shows have: `isEarlyAccess`, `isFree` (Bool) and `releaseDate` (datetime).
Context carries `now: datetime`.

## Requirements

### 1. Subscriber Watch — Shows
- A Subscriber may watch any Show, UNLESS `isEarlyAccess == true` AND
  `context.now < resource.releaseDate`.
- Premium subscribers may watch early-access shows up to 24h before release.

### 2. Subscriber Watch — Movies
- A Subscriber may watch any Movie, UNLESS `needsRentOrBuy == true`.

### 3. FreeMember Watch
- A FreeMember may watch any Movie or Show where `isFree == true`.

### 4. Oscar Promo (Rent/Buy)
- A Subscriber may rent or buy an Oscar-nominated Movie within the promo window
  (2025-02-01 to 2025-03-31).

### 5. Kid Bedtime Restriction (Deny Rule)
- If `profile.isKid == true`, watch is forbidden before 06:00 or after 21:00 local time.

## Notes
- Cedar extension types: `datetime(...)` and `duration(...)`.
- duration() uses Go-style syntax: "24h", "-24h", "1h30m".
- Cedar denies by default.
### 6. Trailer Permissions (Open Access)
- **watch_trailer** is permitted for ANY principal — FreeMember and Subscriber alike,
  with no subscription or tier requirement.
- Trailers are marketing previews; no authentication or subscription gate applies.
- The kid bedtime restriction does NOT apply to trailers (previews are safe for all ages).
- If a Trailer's `durationSeconds > 300` (more than 5 minutes), it is treated as a
  "feature preview" and requires a FreeMember or Subscriber account (no anonymous access).

## Notes (Trailer)
- Trailer is a new entity referencing Movie (`Trailer.movie: Movie`).
- The open-access permit: `permit (principal is [FreeMember, Subscriber], action == watch_trailer, ...)`.
- No forbids beyond the 5-minute preview gate.
