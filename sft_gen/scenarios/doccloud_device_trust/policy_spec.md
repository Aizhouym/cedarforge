# Document Cloud — Policy Specification

## Context

This policy governs access control for a cloud document management platform
with Documents, Users, Groups, Drives, and DocumentShare entities.

Documents have three ACL attributes (viewACL, modifyACL, manageACL) each
pointing to a DocumentShare. The `publicAccess` String attribute controls
unauthenticated access. The `owner` attribute is the owning User.

## Requirements

### 1. Owner Permissions
- The **owner** may perform ALL actions: ViewDocument, ModifyDocument,
  DeleteDocument, EditIsPrivate, EditPublicAccess, AddToShareACL.

### 2. View ACL
- A user in the document's **viewACL** may **ViewDocument**.

### 3. Modify ACL
- A user in the document's **modifyACL** may **ModifyDocument**.

### 4. Manage ACL
- A user in the document's **manageACL** may: AddToShareACL, DeleteDocument,
  EditIsPrivate, EditPublicAccess.

### 5. Public Access
- `publicAccess == "view"` → Public principal may ViewDocument.
- `publicAccess == "edit"` → Public principal may ViewDocument and ModifyDocument.

### 6. Blocking (Deny Rules — Bidirectional)
- If the principal is in the owner's blocked set, or the owner is in the
  principal's blocked set, forbid ViewDocument and ModifyDocument.

### 7. Authentication Requirement (Deny Rule)
- All User actions are forbidden unless `context.is_authenticated == true`.

### 8. Group Owner Permissions
- The **owner** of a Group may DeleteGroup and ModifyGroup.

## Notes
- ACL membership uses Cedar `in` operator: `principal in resource.viewACL`.
- Cedar denies by default.
### 9. Device Trust Gate (Deny Rule)
- **ModifyDocument** and **DeleteDocument** are **forbidden** when
  `context.deviceTrusted == false`.
- Read actions (ViewDocument) are not restricted by device trust.
- ACL management actions (AddToShareACL, EditIsPrivate, EditPublicAccess) are also
  restricted: they require a trusted device.
- Context provides `deviceTrusted: Bool`, set by the authentication layer based on
  device enrollment status.

## Notes (Device Trust)
- The forbid pattern: `forbid ... action in [ModifyDocument, DeleteDocument, ...]
  when { !context.deviceTrusted }`.
- Blocking and authentication gate still apply independently.
- A user on an untrusted device can still view documents but cannot mutate them.
