# Sales Platform — Policy Specification

## Context

This policy governs access control for a B2B sales platform with Users, Jobs,
Markets, Presentations, and Templates.

Users have a `job` attribute (one of: internal, distributor, customer, other) and
belong to one or more `Market` groups. Presentations and Templates have `owner`,
`viewers` (Set<User>), and `editors` (Set<User>) attributes. Templates additionally
have `viewerMarkets` and `editorMarkets` (Set<Market>).

## Requirements

### 1. Presentation — Internal Users
- Any **internal** user may view, duplicate, and edit any Presentation.

### 2. Presentation — Non-Internal Users (Distributors, Customers)
- A non-internal user may **viewPresentation** and **removeSelfAccessFromPresentation**
  if they are in the Presentation's `viewers` or `editors` set.
- A non-internal user may **duplicatePresentation** and **editPresentation** only if
  they are in the Presentation's `editors` set.
- A non-internal user may **grantViewAccess** or **grantEditAccess** to a Presentation
  only if they are in the Presentation's `editors` set.
- Granting requires the context `target` to be in the `viewers`/`editors` set for
  grant-view, or in `editors` for grant-edit.

### 3. Template — Internal Users
- An **internal** user may view, duplicate, and edit any Template.

### 4. Template — Non-Internal Users
- A non-internal user may **viewTemplate** and **duplicateTemplate** if they are in
  the Template's `viewers` set OR their Market is in the Template's `viewerMarkets`.
- A non-internal user may **editTemplate** and **removeOthersAccessToTemplate** only
  if they are in the Template's `editors` set.

### 5. Customer Restriction (Deny Rule)
- Users with `job == "customer"` (customers) may NOT editPresentation or editTemplate.

## Notes
- Job type is modeled as a Cedar entity (Job) with named instances.
- Market membership is via entity hierarchy: `User in [Market]`.
- Cedar denies by default.
### 6. Presentation Tier Restriction
- Presentations have a `tier: String` attribute with values:
  `"standard"`, `"premium"`, `"enterprise"`.
- For **enterprise** tier presentations (`tier == "enterprise"`):
  - Only users whose job is `Job::"internal"` may **editPresentation**.
  - Distributors and customers in the `editors` set may NOT edit enterprise presentations.
  - Viewing (viewPresentation) and duplication are not affected by tier.
- For `"standard"` and `"premium"` tiers, the base access rules apply.

## Notes (Account Tier)
- The tier restriction is an additional forbid layered on top of the existing
  customer restriction: enterprise blocks distributors too.
- Implement as: `forbid editPresentation when resource.tier == "enterprise"
  unless principal.job == Job::"internal"`.
