# Tax Preparer Permissions — Policy Specification

## Context

This policy governs access for a tax preparation platform (Taxpreparer namespace).
Principals: Professional. Resources: Document. Client owns Documents.

Professionals have `assigned_orgs: Set<orgInfo>` where orgInfo = {organization, serviceline, location}.
Documents have `serviceline`, `location: String`, and `owner: Client`.
Clients have `organization: String`.

Context carries `consent: Consent` where Consent = {client: Client, team_region_list: Set<String>}.

## Requirements

### 1. Organization-Level Access
- A Professional may **viewDocument** if `assigned_orgs.contains({organization: resource.owner.organization,
  serviceline: resource.serviceline, location: resource.location})`.

### 2. Ad-Hoc Template Access
- Individual (principal, resource) pairs may be granted viewDocument via policy templates.

### 3. Consent Gate (Deny Rule)
- All viewDocument is forbidden unless: `context.consent.client == resource.owner` AND
  `context.consent.team_region_list.contains(principal.location)`.

## Notes
- All entities are in the `Taxpreparer` namespace.
- Cedar denies by default.
### 4. Corporate Network Gate (Deny Rule)
- All **viewDocument** actions are **forbidden** when `context.onCorporateNetwork == false`.
- This is a compliance requirement: tax documents may only be accessed from the corporate
  network or approved VPN endpoints.
- The network check is applied before the org-match and consent checks — off-network
  requests are blocked universally.
- Context carries `onCorporateNetwork: Bool` set by the network authentication layer.

## Notes (Network Gate)
- The forbid applies to both org-matched access and ad-hoc template access.
- Combined with the consent gate, both conditions must hold: on-network AND valid consent.
